<h1>Meditation Malta</h1>

The project has been undertaken to promote a fictional company based on [project idea 3] called "Meditation Malta". 

The aims of this site is to give the user a good insight and understanding to the services provided by the company but alo give them a quick and accesable way to contact the company in order to avail of the services.

To accomplish this I made sure to give the website claity and a path. The webist is broken down into 4 disticnt sectiosn each offering new information while still holding the theme and feel of the webiste.

Overall, the website serves its purpose of being a promotional front and a point of contact that protrays the company in a positive and friendly manner.

<h1>Meditation Malta</h1>

The project has been undertaken to promote a fictional company based on [project idea 3] called "Meditation Malta". 

The aims of this site is to give the user a good insight and understanding to the services provided by the company but alo give them a quick and accesable way to contact the company in order to avail of the services.

To accomplish this I made sure to give the website claity and a path. The webist is broken down into 4 disticnt sectiosn each offering new information while still holding the theme and feel of the webiste.

Overall, the website serves its purpose of being a promotional front and a point of contact that protrays the company in a positive and friendly manner.

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
I created the navigation bar with navigation in mind, but more particulary knowing where you are. 
The elements of the navigation bar will not only become interactive when you hover on them when looking where to go,  but they will stay highlighted on the current page you are on. 

I did this as i have added links at the bottom of each page that will lead you sequentially to the next page in order. So this will leave the user with the most in-dept experience that has a flow.
I also added the ability to use the logo as a way back to the home as this is a standard in todays websites.


<h3>Landing page</h3>

The landing page image was chosen as i adds a calmness to the page but also falls into the background leaving tha main attention on the content that lays on it.

this image should give them a good introdution to the page but also give a bit of intrigue to keep looking.

<h4>What We do section</h4>
The what we do section is the most content heavy part of the website. i but this on the landing page as when users have to work to try and find info it is less likely to continue interacting.

i split it up into 3 sectios each with a small pin photo, that give a small insight to what is being described.
the description consists of a heading that is the service title and a small paragraph placed adjacent to give the user as much info about it in a short readable amount.


issues:
nav to tick to page
page didnt fill screen
logo
text over photo
gap on photo add instrutions for below

fixed icons with adding the style at bottom

would like to add share or print option to outtimes page
